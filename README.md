## 📖 Overview
The **Mod Box** is a fully modular, high-performance Bluetooth speaker system designed for makers. It features a unique **Dovetail Rail System** with integrated electrical contacts, allowing you to swap speaker pods instantly without handling wires.

Currently powered by **Milwaukee M18** batteries, this project is designed to be platform-agnostic. This repository hosts the source files so you can build your own adapters (DeWalt, Makita, etc.) or design custom speaker enclosures.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* **`/CAD_Source`**: The "Gold" files. Contains `.STEP` files for the Head Unit, Speaker Pods, and Dovetail interface. Import these into Fusion 360, SolidWorks, or Onshape to remix.
* **`/STLs`**: Production-ready mesh files for 3D printing.
* **`/BOM`**: Detailed Bill of Materials and hardware specifications.

## 🛠️ Tech Specs
* **Amplifier:** ZK-3002T Bluetooth 2.0 (300W + 300W)
* **Drivers:** Optimized for SKAR Audio 8" Marine Full Range (SK8MB)
* **Power:** Milwaukee M18 Platform (18V-21V)
* **Material:** PETG HF (Required for heat resistance and durability)

## 🚀 How to Contribute
This project is Open Source because I want to see what *you* can build with it.
1.  **Download the STEP files** from the `/CAD_Source` folder.
2.  **Design a new module** (e.g., a DeWalt battery adapter, a smaller speaker pod, or a storage bin that clips onto the rail).
3.  **Share it!** You can open a "Pull Request" here to have your files added to the official repo, or simply post your remix on MakerWorld/Printables.
